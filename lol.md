# Walkies

This is a tiny electron app that displays full screen and then quits after a timeout.

We use it at UoN to randomise the route for our afternoon walk.

We run it at 3pm via a cron job on a Raspberry Pi connected to a big TV on the wall. <3

## Why do I care?

You may find it useful for randomly running a full screen electron app with a timeout.

## Why is it ugly?

We thought it would be funny.
